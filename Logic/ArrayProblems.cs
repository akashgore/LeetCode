        /**
        * ? 56: Merge Intervals
        * ! Algorithm: 
            We need to check each interval with every other interval for overlap O(n2). Instead, sort intervals by starting point. 
            Once we have the sorted intervals, we can combine all intervals in a linear traversal. 
            The idea is, in sorted array of intervals, if interval[i] doesnâ€™t overlap with interval[i-1], 
            then interval[i+1] cannot overlap with interval[i-1] because 
            starting time of interval[i+1] must be greater than or equal to interval[i].
            Example: [1,3], [4,5], [5,7], [6,8] -> If [4,5] doesnt overlap with [1,3], the rest also won't overlap.
        
        * ! Steps
            1. Sort the intervals based on increasing order of starting time.
            2. Push the first interval on to a stack.
            3. For each interval do the following
                a. If the current interval does not overlap with the stack top, push it.
                b. If the current interval overlaps with stack top and ending time of current interval is more than that of stack top, 
               update stack top with the ending  time of current interval.
            4. At the end stack contains the merged intervals.

        * ? 3:  Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
        * ! Algorithm: Sliding Window: 2 pointer approach
        1. Left Pointer (l) at 0; Right Pointer (r) used to traverse the string s
        2. Use a set to keep track of uniqueness of a substring. 
        3. Use variable "result" to keep track of max length of the substring
        4. While s[r] is present in the set; slide the window from the left by doing the following: 
                a. Remove s[l] from set
                b. Increment Left Pointer (l)
        5. If its not, it means s[r] maintains uniqueness of the substring so: 
                a. Add character: s[r] to the set & 
                b. Update "result" variable as (r-l+1)
