        /**
        * ? 56: Merge Intervals
        * ! Algorithm: 
            We need to check each interval with every other interval for overlap O(n2). Instead, sort intervals by starting point. 
            Once we have the sorted intervals, we can combine all intervals in a linear traversal. 
            The idea is, in sorted array of intervals, if interval[i] doesnâ€™t overlap with interval[i-1], 
            then interval[i+1] cannot overlap with interval[i-1] because 
            starting time of interval[i+1] must be greater than or equal to interval[i].
            Example: [1,3], [4,5], [5,7], [6,8] -> If [4,5] doesnt overlap with [1,3], the rest also won't overlap.
        
        * ! Steps
            1. Sort the intervals based on increasing order of starting time.
            2. Push the first interval on to a stack.
            3. For each interval do the following
                a. If the current interval does not overlap with the stack top, push it.
                b. If the current interval overlaps with stack top and ending time of current interval is more than that of stack top, 
               update stack top with the ending  time of current interval.
            4. At the end stack contains the merged intervals.

        1. Left Pointer (l) at 0; Right Pointer (r) used to traverse the string s
        2. Use a set to keep track of uniqueness of a substring. 
        3. Use variable "result" to keep track of max length of the substring
        4. While s[r] is present in the set; slide the window from the left by doing the following:

                b. Increment Left Pointer (l)

        I was thinking of a car. It needs to get parked in the garage. 
        In case the array has a length of one we are really lucky as the car is already in the garage. 
        Otherwise we need to get to the garage somehow. To get to the garage we pick up fuel along the way. 
        If we ever run out of gas then it's game over.

        We start by filling up the car at index = 0. 
        If we are already out of gas we won't be able to pick up any more gas so game over. 
        To get to the next array index it costs one fuel. 
        At the next index we can choose to stick with the fuel tank we already have (which now contains fuel - 1 amount of fuel), or pick up a new tank at the next index. 
        Some indices (nums[i] == 0) don't have any fuel so we will need to stick with what we got on those indices. 
        Hopefully we will make it back to the garage.
